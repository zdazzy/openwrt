Subject: [PATCH] wifi: rtw88: 8812a: Mitigate beacon loss

The RTL8812AU has a reception problem, maybe only in the 5 GHz band.
Sometimes, in some positions, it stops receiving anything even though
the distance to the AP is only ~3 meters and there are no obstacles.
Moving it a few centimeters fixes it.

Switch the initial gain to maximum coverage when there is beacon loss.
This only helps sometimes. This is similar to what the official driver
does.

Subject: [PATCH 126/383] arm64: dts: rockchip: Lower SD card speed on rk3399
 Pinebook Pro

MicroSD card slot in the Pinebook Pro is located on a separate
daughterboard that's connected to the mainboard using a rather
long flat cable.  The resulting signal degradation causes many
perfectly fine microSD cards not to work in the Pinebook Pro,
which is a common source of frustration among the owners.

Changing the mode and lowering the speed reportedly fixes this
issue and makes many microSD cards work as expected.
